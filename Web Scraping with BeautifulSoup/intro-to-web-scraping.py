# Web Scraping

# Objectives:
# - Define what web scraping is and the issues surrounding it
# - Use the requests and BeautifulSoup modules to parse HTML
# - Explain some common technical problems with web scraping
# - Explore other tools that can interact with web pages


# What is Web Scraping?
# - Web scraping involves programmatically grabbing data from a web page
# - Three Steps: Download, extract data, do something with the data (PROFIT! :P)


# Why Scrape?
# - There's data on a site that you want to store or analyze
# - You can't get by other means (e.g. an API)
# - You want to programmatically grab the data (instead of lots of manual copying/pasting)


# Is it... ok?
# - Some websites don't want people scraping them
# - Best practice: consult the robots.txt file
# - If making many requests, time them out
# - If you're too aggressive, your IP can be blocked
