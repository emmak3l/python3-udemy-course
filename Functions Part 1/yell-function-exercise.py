# Yell Function Exercise
# Implement a function yell  which accepts a single string argument.  It should return(not print) an uppercased version of the string with an exclamation point aded at the end.  For example:

# yell("go away")   # "GO AWAY!"

# yell("leave me alone")   # "LEAVE ME ALONE!"

# You do not need to call the function to pass the tests.

def yell(string):
	return string.upper() + "!"
