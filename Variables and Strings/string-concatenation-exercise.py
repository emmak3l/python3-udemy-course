#Set the variable called greeting  to some greeting, e.g. "hello".
greeting = "Howdy"

#Set the variable called name  to some name, e.g. "Heisenberg".
name = "Woody"

#Then set the variable called greet_name  so that it concatenates greeting , name , and a space " " between them.
greet_name = greeting + " " + name
