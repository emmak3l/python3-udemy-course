#Set the variable called first  to your first name.
first = "Emma"

#Set the variable called last  to your last name.
last = "K"

#Then set the variable called formatted  to a new string that interpolates both values (from the first and last variables) using f-strings or the .format()  method.  Make sure you follow this exact pattern for the new string that you store to the formatted variable (pay attention to capital/lowercase letters, spaces, commas, etc)
formatted = f"First Name: {first}, Last Name: {last}"
