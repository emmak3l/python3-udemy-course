# Creating Lists Exercise
# It's time to create your own lists. Define 2 separate lists:
#	- First, define a list called my_stuff. It must be at least 4 elements long.
#	  The data is completely up to you, but it must contain at least 1 string and 1 float
#	- Next, define a list called nums.
#	  It should be a list that contains all the numbers from 1-99 (including 99)
#	  Don't type this out manually! Use what we learned at the end of the previous video!

# Define my_stuff
my_stuff = ['phone', 'computer', 6.7888, True, 1, False]

# Define nums
nums = list(range(1,100))

print(nums)
print(my_stuff)
