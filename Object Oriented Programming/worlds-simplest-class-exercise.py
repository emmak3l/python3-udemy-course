# World's Simplest Class Exercise
# Define a class called Vehicle.
#  It should be completely empty (just add a pass statement inside)
#   After the class is defined, create two instances of Vehicle.
#    Save one to a variable called car  and another to a variable called boat

# naming convention is to name classes in the singular (like User instead of Users) and to use CamelCase

# define the Vehicle class below:
class Vehicle:
	pass

# instantiate a new Vehicle and save it to a variable called car:
car = Vehicle()

# instantiate a new Vehicle and save it to a variable called boat:
boat = Vehicle()
